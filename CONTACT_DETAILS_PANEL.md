# Contact Details Panel Integration

## Overview
Added a 4th column to the chat interface following the Podium-style layout, displaying comprehensive contact information for the selected conversation.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Component: ContactDetailsPanel.tsx
**Location:** `/home/appointment-platform/apps/frontend/src/Components/Chat/ContactDetailsPanel.tsx`

**Features:**
- **Header Section:** Large avatar with patient name and badge
- **Contact Information:** Phone and email display with icons
- **Treatment Plan:** Shows treatment type, duration, priority, and priority window
- **Representative Info:** Displays guardian/parent information if patient is a dependent
- **Contact Preferences:** Shows preferred contact method (SMS/Call)
- **Notes & Additional Info:** Patient notes and additional information fields
- **Conversation Status:** Unread message count and archived status

**Data Flow:**
- Receives `ConversationChat` object from parent
- Extracts phone number from conversation owner/lastMessage author
- Queries Appointment collection to fetch full patient details
- Uses populate to include priority, treatment, providers, and representative data
- Falls back gracefully when no appointment exists (shows basic conversation info)

### 2. Layout Updates: CustomChat.tsx
**Location:** `/home/appointment-platform/apps/frontend/src/Routes/Messages/CustomChat.tsx`

**Column Distribution (4 columns total):**
- Categories Panel: `15%` (was 18%)
- Conversations List: `18%` (was 20%)
- Chat Window: `45%` (was flexible/auto)
- Contact Details Panel: `22%` (new)

**Responsive Behavior:**
- All panels are full-width stacked on mobile (`base`)
- 4-column layout on desktop (`xl` breakpoint)
- Consistent glass morphism styling across all panels
- Synchronized scrollbar styling

### 3. Visual Design
- **Glass Effect:** Translucent background with backdrop blur and saturation
- **Color Mode Support:** Uses `useColorModeValue` for light/dark themes
- **Avatar System:** Integrates with existing avatar color system using `getAvatarColors()`
- **Consistent Spacing:** Matches existing panel padding and border radius
- **Scrollable Content:** Independent scroll for long contact details

## Technical Details

### Props Interface
```typescript
interface ContactDetailsPanelProps {
  conversation: ConversationChat | null;
}
```

### Populate Fields
```typescript
const populateFields = [
  { path: "priority", select: "id description notes durationHours name color" },
  { path: "treatment", select: "_id name notes duration icon color minIcon" },
  { path: "providers" },
  {
    path: "representative.appointment",
    select: "phoneInput phoneE164 emailLower nameInput lastNameInput sid proxyAddress",
  },
  { path: "selectedDates.days.timeBlocks" },
];
```

### State Management
- Contact details automatically update when `chat` state changes in parent
- Uses React Query for efficient data fetching and caching
- Shows loading spinner during data fetch
- Empty state when no conversation is selected

## Usage
The component is fully integrated and will display automatically when a conversation is selected in the chat interface. No additional configuration required.

## Benefits

2. **Reduced Navigation:** No need to switch views to check appointment details
3. **Improved UX:** Follows familiar Podium interface pattern
4. **Responsive Design:** Adapts to different screen sizes gracefully
5. **Extensible:** Easy to add more sections (appointment history, documents, etc.)
